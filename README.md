# Task 1: UNEMPLOYMENT ANALYSIS WITH PYTHON

Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. We have seen a sharp increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19, so in this project we will be analyzing the unemployment rate.


# Task 2: SALES PREDICTION  WITH PYTHON

Sales prediction means predicting how much of a product people will buy based on factors
such as the amount you spend to advertise your product, the segment of people you
advertise for, or the platform you are advertising on about your product.

Typically, a product and service-based business always need their Data Scientist to predict
their future sales with every step they take to manipulate the cost of advertising their
product
